**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
*I found sentiment analysis to be the most interesting topic. It offers a unique way to extract actionable insights from textual data, such as news articles or social media posts, and its applications in financial markets, especially for predicting stock movements, are particularly compelling.*

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
*I am interested in developing a comprehensive predictive model for stock markets that integrates fundamental indicators, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis. The model would aim to either predict stock price movements or provide recommendations for buy/sell decisions, leveraging data from diverse sources to enhance accuracy.*

**What is a potential change you would make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
*Incorporating additional data sources, such as technical indicator analysis, into our current model could improve its ability to predict stock prices. This change would provide a more holistic perspective by combining historical price patterns with fundamental and sentiment-based insights.*

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
*I am interested in exploring advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning models, to analyze complex relationships in financial data. Additionally, applying techniques like ensemble learning or reinforcement learning could enhance the robustness and decision-making capability of our models.*
